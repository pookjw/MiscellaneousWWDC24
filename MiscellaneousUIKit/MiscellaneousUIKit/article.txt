South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol’s is set to survive impeachment after a vote against him was boycotted by governing party lawmakers on Saturday.

In another day of high drama, a number of lawmakers left parliament ahead of the vote to impeach President Yoon over his decision to impose a short-lived period of martial law earlier this week. Just two remained inside while the one governing lawmaker who returned voted against the motion.

At least 200 lawmakers are needed for the vote to be carried out. Outside the main hall, opposition lawmakers could be heard shouting, “Go inside [the chamber]!” and calling them “cowards.”

Voting is underway but will likely be rendered moot as numbers counted won’t be enough for the motion to pass. Less than two thirds of parliament now remain in the chamber.

If, as expected, it fails, the next available date lawmakers can vote on Yoon’s impeachment is Wednesday, December 11.
