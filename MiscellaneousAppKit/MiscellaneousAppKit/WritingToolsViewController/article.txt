Donald Trump slammed the Olympic Games opening ceremony as “disgraceful” and defended JD Vance’s sexist comments in a wide-ranging interview with Fox News on Monday night.

Host Laura Ingraham had asked the former president what he thinks women who haven’t had children might think of his running mate’s comments after he branded Kamala Harris and other women “childless cat ladies”.

“I think they understand it,” Trump claimed.

In the interview, the former president also again refused to commit to debating Harris, only suggesting that he will “probably” do so.

“The answer is yes, I’ll probably end up debating... The answer is yes, but I can also make a case for not doing it,” he said.

This comes as new details continue to emerge about the assassination attempt on the former president at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

On Tuesday, the Senate’s Judiciary and Homeland and Government Affairs committees will hold a joint hearing, where FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate and acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe are scheduled to speak.

Questions continue to mount about the response of authorities that day – with new texts between law enforcement giving further insight into what went wrong.
